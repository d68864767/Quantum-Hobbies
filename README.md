# Quantum Hobbies

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a paragraph about quantum physics based on a given prompt.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace 'your-key' with your actual key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
```

## Usage

Run the `quantum_hobbies.py` script with a prompt about quantum physics. For example:

```bash
python quantum_hobbies.py
```

This will print a paragraph about quantum physics generated by the GPT-3 model.

## Files

- `config.py`: This file retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variables.
- `quantum_hobbies.py`: This file contains the main function that generates a paragraph about quantum physics.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages required to run the project.

## Dependencies

- numpy==1.21.2
- scipy==1.7.1
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- pandas==1.3.3
- openai==0.27.0

Please ensure that you have these packages installed before running the project.

## Note

Please ensure that you have set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable before running the project. If the key is not found, the `config.py` file will raise a ValueError.
